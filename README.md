# [Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator](https://github.com/maulik-vyas/SalaryPredictionProject) 
* Created a tool that examine a set of attributes with salaries and then predict salaries for a new set of job postings. The model will   decide the salary for present as well as future employees of any organization.
* Scraped over 1 million datasets using Python and Machine Learning algorithms as well as packages.
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value of each attribute in the final salary. 
* Optimized Linear, Second order Polynomial Linear, Gradient Boosting and Ridge Regressor using 5-fold Cross Validation to reach the       best model. 
* Automated pipeline for Ridge Regression and predicted salaries from new data. 

# [Project 2: Flower Classification](https://github.com/maulik-vyas/IRIS-Dataset-Project)
* Developed a model to classify flowers from sepal langth, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
* Did Exploratory Data Analysis to discover correlation among them.
* Utilized ML models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis, CART, and SVM to find     out the best model with highest accuraccy.

# [Project 3: Titanic Project](https://github.com/maulik-vyas/Titanic-Project)
* Analyzed the sinking of the Titanic sheep to explore whether any groups were priortized.
* Did Data Wrangling by filling up Nan with mean values, dropping inefficient columns, and label encoding.
* Used GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross validation to tune the hyperparameters of each Machine Learning model to find out the model with     optimum parameters.
* Evaluated Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to get the best one with highest metrics.

# [Project 4: SUV Prediction Project](https://github.com/maulik-vyas/SUV-Prediction)
* Developed a model that predict the people who will be interested to purchase a new SUV model.
* The model is built by exploring the previous data about the sales of their SUVs such as, Gender, Age, Estimated Salary, and whether     someone purchased or not.

# [Project 5: House Price Prediction Project](https://github.com/maulik-vyas/HousePricePredictionProject)
* The main object of this assignment is to examine a set of housing prices in Boston based upon a set of features. After successfully     training this model on train data, if it is seen as a good fit then it could be used to make certain predictions about a home â€”         particularly its price.
* R^2 score of different models are compared to get the best model.

# [Project 6: Movie Recommendation Model](https://github.com/maulik-vyas/MovieRecommendationModel)
* The primary aim of this Machine Learning model is to recommend movies to users according to their interest. 
* Built a utility matrix to combine different movie ratings given by each user and decomposed various users' taste into 12 categories.
* In the model, from the dataset, any movie is selected and then relevant movies are suggested to the user.

# [Project 7: Brain Weight by Head Size](https://github.com/maulik-vyas/BrainWeightProject)
* The objective of this problem is to check how linearly head size is correlated with the Brain Weight by using Linear Regression         Algorithm and find out R^2 and root mean square error.

# [Project 8: Car Recommendation Model](https://github.com/maulik-vyas/AutomobilesRecommenderModel)
* A simple ML model to suggest cars to the customers according to their wish list. Just like as when a customer approaches any car         dealer and he suggests a car based upon the requirements, this model does the same thing by means of k-Nearest Neighbors.

# [Project 9: Loan Recommendation Model](https://github.com/maulik-vyas/LoanRecommendationModel)
* A very simple bank loan recommendation model to identify how many users actually liked the offers and how many of the users' preferred       loans were recommended.
