Data Science Portfolio

# [Project 1: Data Science Salary Estimator](https://github.com/maulik-vyas/SalaryPredictionProject) 
* Created a tool that examine a set of attributes with salaries and then predict salaries for a new set of job postings. The model will   decide the salary for present as well as future employees of any organization.
* Scraped over 1 million datasets using Python and Machine Learning algorithms as well as packages.
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value of each attribute in the final salary. 
* Optimized Linear, Second order Polynomial Linear, Gradient Boosting and Ridge Regressor using 5-fold Cross Validation to reach the       best model. 
* Automated pipeline for Ridge Regression and predicted salaries from new data. 

# [Project 2: Flower Classification](https://github.com/maulik-vyas/IRIS-Dataset-Project)
* Developed a model to classify flowers from sepal langth, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
